        <p>
          UC Davis has a multitude of food options, from the CoHo, to the Silo, to dining halls, and food trucks. A part of a three week Fellowship Design Challenge, we wanted to create an exciting digital platform that rewards current students for visiting their favorite on-campus dining spots. AggieRewards simplifies the process of earning rewards by seamlessly integrating with students' daily dining routines. With a user-friendly interface, students can easily navigate menus, place orders, and track their rewards progressâ€”all from their smartphones. Tailored recommendations, exclusive promotions, and discounts cater to each student's preferences, ensuring a rewarding and customized dining experience every time.

  <p>As my first UI/UX design project, I learned a lot about the process of creating an app. It's crucial to consider users' challenges and provide helpful design when they encounter issues. This project boosted my skills in Figma and prototyping. Working with classmates, each with a different plan, improved my design thinking and interaction skills. The hardest part was deciding what to include and how to design it. There were many things I wanted to add, but I had to choose only a few to highlight the main aspects of the app. Experimenting with colors and styles was challenging, as some worked well in one part but not in others. Despite the difficulties, I enjoyed working on this project. I extend profound gratitude to Professor William Mead for his unwavering support and guidance throughout this endeavor. Thank you!</p></div>
