        <h1>Foodix - From Foodbank to You</h1>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Foodix is a online delivery app with a simple yet powerful goal - to connect low-income households with nearby food banks, allowing them to preorder essential groceries effortlessly. As someone who has struggled living paycheck to paycheck, I know that time is a precious resource. By connecting users with nearby food banks and allowing them to preorder groceries, Foodix not only helps families who struggle with time constraints but also ensure that the food in food banks reaches more people rather than being needlessly discarded.By creating a user-friendly interface, I hope to empower individuals facing food insecurity and provide a convient way to access the resources they need.</p>

          <h2>My Role</h2>
          <p>My role in this project is to create an app that would assist in providing an easier access to food and groceries. I conducted user interiews and identified what the outcomes of this product would consist. What major features this app include, how users can achieve their goal within the app, and how they would go about doing it, were all questions I took into consideration during the research process.</p>
          <p>In the design phase, I identified the most important aspects of the app and brainstormed how I could make those aspects not just functional but also intuitive and accessible.</p>

        <h2>Initial Proposal Feedback</h2>
        <p>Before diving into the brainstorming phase for Foodix, the initial proposal underwent a series of constructive feedback conversations among fellow designers. As a solo designer on this project, the collaborative feedback process served as a blueprint for ideas and a source of valuable insights. Here are just a few notes taken during one of the sections.</p>
